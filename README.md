## Overview

This project was done for a challenge in the frontend mentor website. This being a newbie project was not very hard to do.
The page consists of a rating component that accepts input from user and displays the result in the next state of the page, with a thank you message.

## My process

As usual started off with the UI of the page. I have seen many times people recommending to start the project with the mobile first approach
but still I haven't gotten familiar with it. Once the UI is done I concentrated on the interactivity of the page. Initially I used paragraphs tag in HTML to contain the rating numbers. Due to managing the clicked state of the rating I switched to radio buttons as it is easier to manage to clicked state and used custom styling for them.  
By switching the display properties for rating state and thank you state I managed to display each component at a time in the page.
Managing the SVG file was a new thing to me, so I fought with it for sometime, but it was not that hard, rather just a google search away, so I figured it put.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Though I have been introduced to DOM manipulation for quite some time, projects like these nurture my ability to operate effectively in the DOM.
-I got familiar with toggling class names for an element in HTMl using Js.

- customizing the radio buttons.

### Continued development

Styling the forms in HTML is bit of a hectic task. I have spent quite some time wrapping my head around it while I was doing a lesson regarding that in The Odin Project. Still I need lot of improvement in that particular feature.
